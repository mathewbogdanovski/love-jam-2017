# catui
A very light-weight GUI framework for the Löve2D

## What do I want in my GUI library?
+ Simple
+ Light-weight
+ Extensible
+ Rich events

## Explain
You should expand your own control, but you can also use the control folder under the control

## Example
```
require "catui"

local myBtn = UIControl:new()
myBtn:setPos(100, 100)
myBtn:setSize(100, 40)

myBtn.events:on(UI_DRAW, function()
    local box = self:getBoundingBox()
    local x, y = box.left, box.top
    local w, h = box:getWidth(), box:getHeight()
    love.graphics.setColor(0, 255, 0, 255)
    love.graphics.rectangle(x, y, w, h)
end, myBtn)

myBtn.events:on(UI_CLICK, function()
    print("my buton is click")
end)

UIManager:getInstance().rootCtrl.coreContainer:addChild(myBtn)
```
